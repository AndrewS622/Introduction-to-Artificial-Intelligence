# Introduction-to-Artificial-Intelligence
CS50's Introduction to AI on EdX

This repository contains programming assignments from HarvardX's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course on EdX, a continuation of CS50 with a focus on AI. The course is broken up into seven lectures, quizzes, and assignments, which cover the following AI topics:

1. Search- Depth-First, Breadth-First, Greedy Best-First, A*, and Minimax Algorithms
2. Knowledge- Propositional Logic, Inference, Model Checking, Conjunctive Normal Form, and First-Order Logic
3. Uncertainty- Probability, Bayes' Theorem, Bayesian Networks, Inference by Enumeration, Sampling, Markov Chains and Hidden Markov Models
4. Optimization- Local Search, Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, Linear Programming, and Constraint Satisfaction Problems
5. Learning- Supervised Learning, Classification, Support Vector Machines, Regression, Reinforcement Learning, and Clustering
6. Neural Networks- Gradient Descent, Backpropagation, TensorFlow, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Recurrent Neural Networks
7. Language- Natural Language Processing, Context-Free Grammar, Markov Models, Naive Bayes, Information Extraction and Word Representation

All programming is done in Python and the assignments for each week are as follows:
1. 0a. Degrees- Write a program that determines how many degrees of separation apart two actors are.
1. 0b. Tic-Tac-Toe- Implement an AI to play Tic-Tac-Toe optimally by using minimax.
2. 1a. Knights- Write a program to solve logic puzzles. 
2. 1b. Minesweeper- Write an AI to play Minesweeper using logical inference.
3. 2a. PageRank- Write an AI to rank web pages by importance, using both sampling and iteration.
3. 2b. Heredity- Write an AI to assess the likelihood that a person will have a particular genetic trait.
4. 3a. Crossword- Write an AI to generate crossword puzzles.
5. 4a. Shopping- Write an AI to predict whether online shopping customers will complete a purchase.
5. 4b. Nim- Write an AI that teaches itself to play Nim through reinforcement learning.
6. 5a. Traffic- Write an AI to identify which traffic sign appears in a photograhph.
7. 6a. Parser- Write an AI to parse sentences and extract noun phrases.
7. 6b. Questions- Write an AI to answer questions.
